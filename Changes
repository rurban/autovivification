        + Add : 'fetch' also applies to aliasing ("for ($hashref->{key}) { }").
        + Fix : Don't segfault on "keys/values %$hashref", and don't vivify if
                'fetch' is set.
        + Fix : Plain dereferencing shouldn't have a different behaviour when
                the pragma is in use.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.
