Revision history for autovivification

0.03    2009-06-23 22:20 UTC
        + Add : Handle old-fashion dereferencing (like $$hashref{key}).
        + Chg : Aliasing constructs (for ($x{foo}) { ... }) are now covered by
                the 'store' category (and no longer the 'fetch' one). This is
                because there's no way to know at compile-time if the alias
                will be assigned to.
        + Fix : Quadratic complexity at compile-time.
        + Fix : Segfaults when dereferencing globals.
        + Fix : Segfaults on big-endian systems.
        + Tst : Really test plain arrays and hashes.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.

        + Add : 'fetch' also applies to aliasing ("for ($hashref->{key}) { }").
        + Fix : Don't segfault on "keys/values %$hashref", and don't vivify if
                'fetch' is set.
        + Fix : Plain dereferencing shouldn't have a different behaviour when
                the pragma is in use.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.
