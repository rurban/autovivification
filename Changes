Revision history for autovivification

0.11    2013-02-08 19:25 UTC
        This is a maintenance release. The code contains no functional change.
        Satisfied users of version 0.10 can skip this update.
        + Doc : POD tweaks and clarifications.
        + Tst : Threads tests will not fail anymore if resources constraints
                prevent the system from creating all the required threads.
        + Tst : Author tests overhaul.

0.10    2011-08-24 15:00 UTC
        + Fix : The pragma no longer vivifies the "autovivification" entry
                in the hints hash %^H on perl 5.8.

0.09    2011-01-05 18:40 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #64435] : Hangs with File::Copy in Config.pm.
                This was actually a regression introduced together with the new
                peephole optimizer strategy, and that caused the pragma to hang
                on constructs like "for (;;) { ... }".
                Thanks Michael Schilli for reporting.

0.08    2011-01-03 21:00 UTC
        + Fix : Building on Windows.

0.07    2010-12-31 16:20 UTC
        + Chg : perl 5.8.3 is required.
        + Doc : Complements and clarifications.
        + Fix : Segmentation faults and misbehaviours in threaded applications.
        + Fix : Compatibility with perl 5.13.7.
                Thanks Andreas J. KÃ¶nig for reporting and Andrew Main for
                providing a fix.
        + Fix : Broken linkage on Windows with gcc 3.4, which appears in
                particular when using ActivePerl's default compiler suite.
                For those setups, the autovivification shared library will now
                be linked against the perl dll directly (instead of the import
                library).
        + Opt : The pragma takes slightly more time at compile-time, but is
                slightly faster at run-time.
        + Tst : Lengthy tests have been ported to Test::Leaner, making the
                whole test suite about 50% faster.
        + Tst : Threads tests are now only run on perl 5.13.4 and higher.
                They could segfault randomly because of what seems to be an
                internal bug of Perl, which has been addressed in 5.13.4.
                There is also an environment variable that allows you to
                forcefully run those tests, but it should be set only for
                author testing and not for end users.

0.06    2010-04-24 17:40 UTC
        + Add : The A_THREADSAFE and A_FORKSAFE constants.
        + Fix : [RT #56870] : "no autovivification" vs Regexp::Common.
                This was a bug in how tied arrays and hashes were handled.
                Thanks Michael G. Schwern for reporting.
        + Fix : Scope leaks under perl 5.8-5.10.0.
        + Fix : Segfaults when first loading the pragma from inside a thread.

0.05    2010-03-05 23:15 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #55154] : Crashes and assertion failures when deparsing and
                re-eval-uating some code compiled while autovivification was in
                use.
                Thanks Michael G. Schwern for reporting.
        + Fix : [RT #53647] : "leys" typo in pod.
                Thanks Hinrik Orn Sigurdsson for reporting.

0.04    2010-01-10 00:30 UTC
        + Add : Array and hash slices are now handled by the pragma.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.

0.03    2009-06-23 22:20 UTC
        + Add : Handle old-fashion dereferencing (like $$hashref{key}).
        + Chg : Aliasing constructs (for ($x{foo}) { ... }) are now covered by
                the 'store' category (and no longer the 'fetch' one). This is
                because there's no way to know at compile-time if the alias
                will be assigned to.
        + Fix : Quadratic complexity at compile-time.
        + Fix : Segfaults when dereferencing globals.
        + Fix : Segfaults on big-endian systems.
        + Tst : Really test plain arrays and hashes.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.

0.02    2009-06-17 18:05 UTC
        + Add : 'fetch' also applies to aliasing ("for ($hashref->{key}) { }").
        + Fix : Don't segfault on "keys/values %$hashref", and don't vivify if
                'fetch' is set.
        + Fix : Plain dereferencing shouldn't have a different behaviour when
                the pragma is in use.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.

0.01    2009-06-14 20:10 UTC
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
