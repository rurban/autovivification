Revision history for autovivification

0.05    2010-03-05 23:15 UTC
        + Fix : [RT #55154] : Crashes and assertion failures when deparsing and
                re-eval-uating some code compiled while autovivification was in
                use.
                Thanks Michael G. Schwern for reporting.
        + Fix : [RT #53647] : "leys" typo in pod.
                Thanks Hinrik Orn Sigurdsson for reporting.

0.04    2010-01-10 00:30 UTC
        + Add : Array and hash slices are now handled by the pragma.
        + Fix : Work around Kwalitee test misfailures.

0.03    2009-06-23 22:20 UTC
        + Add : Handle old-fashion dereferencing (like $$hashref{key}).
        + Chg : Aliasing constructs (for ($x{foo}) { ... }) are now covered by
                the 'store' category (and no longer the 'fetch' one). This is
                because there's no way to know at compile-time if the alias
                will be assigned to.
        + Fix : Quadratic complexity at compile-time.
        + Fix : Segfaults when dereferencing globals.
        + Fix : Segfaults on big-endian systems.
        + Tst : Really test plain arrays and hashes.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.

0.02    2009-06-17 18:05 UTC
        + Add : 'fetch' also applies to aliasing ("for ($hashref->{key}) { }").
        + Fix : Don't segfault on "keys/values %$hashref", and don't vivify if
                'fetch' is set.
        + Fix : Plain dereferencing shouldn't have a different behaviour when
                the pragma is in use.
        + Tst : Improved coverage.
